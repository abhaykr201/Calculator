For any query on this you email me on abhaykr201@gmail.com with subject 'Expression calculator issue'




Evaluate an entered algebraic expression (no calculus or trig) of arbitrary complexity (i.e. "bring it on!")
e.g. ((3^6^2)+(-8^2)^(2/(pi^e)))+x^(x+2)-300r5

If there is an error in the syntax of the expression, show an error message that identifies the error.

If the entered expression is successfully evaluated, copy it as a line to the log area on the screen, followed by an "=" sign, followed by the value of the expression. Then clear the input field, or provide a CLEAR button near the input area. Allow the user to copy/paste from the "log" area into the entry text field to easily modify any previously-entered expression.
